Noriko Yakushiji was born in Tokyo. She learned violin from an early age, and started taking singing lessons from the age of 16.

After graduating from Tokyo University of the Arts, she studied in Belgium with a grant from the Belgian government. Under the tutelage of Marianne Pousseur, she finished the Master’s program of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels with a scholarship from the Nomura Foundation. She finished the advanced master program in contemporary music (Ictus / Spectra academy) of the Royal conservatory of Ghent under the supervision of Filip Rathé.

She was a laureate of the Concours des Nouveaux Talents de l'Art Lyrique in Ans, finalist of the Bel Arte International Vocal Competition, and obtained the 3rd prize in the Contemporary Music Competition "Kyogaku XIII" in Tokyo. 
Her main interests lie in contemporary music. She has performed world premieres and Japanese premieres of works by many composers, including Nicolas Bacri, Claude Ledoux, Henri Pousseur, Silvano Bussotti, Yoriaki Matsudaira and Motoharu Kawashima.
Her opera debut was the lead role in Ravel's "L'enfant et les sortilèges" at the Royal Opera of Liège, directed by Marianne Pousseur.
Other Baroque opera roles include Virtu in Monteverdi’s "L'incoronazione di Poppea", Second Woman in Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas" in London and Antwerp. In contemporary opera, she has performed the world premieres of the roles of Rito in Riles Walsh's "The East Complex" at the Flanders Opera House, Alto in Yoriaki Matsudaira's "The Provocators" and Miharu Ogura's mono opera "Call".

She performed in such festivals as Ars Musica in Belgium, Belgian Music Days and the Sirga international contemporary music festival in Spain. Her performance of "The Music of Furniture" by Yuki Nakahashi was aired on NHK-FM in 2019.
Recently, she co-organised and premiered the contemporary chamber opera "Amidst dust and fractured voices" by Koji Takahashi at the Miry Concert Hall in Ghent. This opera also was performed at the "Phaino" festival in Brussels and in Tokyo.
As a member of Uta × Koto, an ensemble of contemporary voice, koto and clarinet formed by composer Sehyon Jo in 2018, she explores new expression through a combination of contemporary and classical, western and oriental that transcends time and space.
She currently studies baroque music under Makoto Sakurada and Utai (Noh-theater voice) under Tomotaka Sekine, a Noh performer of the Kanze school.
