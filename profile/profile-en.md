Noriko Yakushiji was born in Tokyo.
After graduating from Tokyo University of the Arts, she studied in Belgium with a grant from the Belgian government. Under the tutelage of Marianne Pousseur, she finished the Master’s program of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels with a scholarship from the Nomura Foundation. She finished the advanced master program in contemporary music (Ictus / Spectra academy) of the Royal conservatory of Ghent under the supervision of Filip Rathé.

Her main interests lie in contemporary music.
She obtained the 3rd prize in the Contemporary Music Competition "Kyogaku XIII" in Tokyo. She has performed world premieres and Japanese premieres of works by many composers, including Nicolas Bacri, Claude Ledoux, Henri Pousseur, Silvano Bussotti, Yu Kuwabara, Hidehiko Hinohara, Yoriaki Matsudaira and Motoharu Kawashima.
In contemporary opera, she has performed the world premieres of the roles of Rito in Riles Walsh’s "The East Complex" at the Flanders Opera House, Alto in Yoriaki Matsudaira’s "The Provocators"and Miharu Ogura’s mono opera "Call". She co-organised and premiered the contemporary chamber opera "Amidst dust and fractured voices" by Koji Takahashi at the Miry Concert Hall in Ghent. This opera also was performed at the "Phaino" festival in Brussels and in Tokyo, and won the first prize at the 2023 edition of the Tokyo University of the Arts Festival.

In 2024, she performed in the recital series B→C (from Bach to Contemporary) organised by the Tokyo Opera City Foundation. The programme consisted of Noh-theater voice and melisma.
She appeared at such festivals as Ars Musica in Belgium, Belgian Music Days and the Sirga international contemporary music festival in Spain. Her performance of "The Music of Furniture" by Yuki Nakahashi was aired on NHK-FM.

 As a member of Uta × Koto, an ensemble of contemporary voice, koto and clarinet formed by composer Sehyon Jo in 2018, she explores new expression through a combination of contemporary and classical, western and oriental that transcends time and space. She currently studies baroque music under Makoto Sakurada and Utai (Noh-theater voice) under Tomotaka Sekine, a Noh performer of the Kanze school.
